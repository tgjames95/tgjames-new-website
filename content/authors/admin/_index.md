I am a health education scientist, [Certified Health Education Specialist](http://nchec.org/), and Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Michigan in the Department of Family Medicine. At the University of Michigan, I am working with the [Center for Disability Health and Wellness](https://disabilityhealth.medicine.umich.edu/) and the [Michigan Mixed Methods Program](https://www.tylergjames.com/mixedmethods.org) to apply quantitative methods - including Latent Class Analysis and Latent Profile Analysis, time-varying effect modeling, structural equation modeling, and psychometrics -, qualitative methods, and mixed methods to (1) develop, refine, and advance health behavior theory and measurement, and (2) reduce health disparities - particularly those caused by inequities in health services utilization and delivery - among priority populations.

My research has received generous support from:

* The University of Florida’s [Graduate School Fellowship](http://graduateschool.ufl.edu/prospective-students/funding/graduate-school-funding-awards/) (08/2016 - 08/2020)
* The [Society for Public Health Education’s](http://www.sophe.org/) Student Fellowship in Patient Engagement (09/2018 - 09/2019)
* The [Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s](http://www.ahrq.gov/) R36 Health Services Research Dissertation mechanism (04/2020 - 08/2021)
