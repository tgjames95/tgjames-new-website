## Spread the Sign

[Spread the Sign](https://www.spreadthesign.com/en.us/search/) is a free video sign language dictionary for ASL and other signed languages. There is also a free app available in the Apple App Store and Google Play store. I highly recommend that all students and teaching assistants download this app.

## DCMP

[DCMP](https://dcmp.org/) is the Described and Captioned Media Program managed by the National Association of the Deaf. It is free to create an account but does take a few days to become active. Their [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/dcmpnad) channel has a variety of resources including vocabulary building videos (~30 minutes each) related to: English, Psychology, Math, Science, Government, and Computers.

## The Daily Moth

[The Daily Moth](https://www.facebook.com/TheDailyMoth/?fref=ts) is news source produced in ASL by a former graduate of the Florida School for the Deaf and Blind. This is excellent practice for students because (1) it is all current events, (2) the host provides exposure to fingerspelling, and (3) a transcript is provided for all videos which can be used to compare comprehension.
