abstract: HIV-related stigma remains a considerable barrier to engaging at-risk
  populations in HIV testing and prevention programs. We assessed the moderating
  role of HIV-related stigma on the relation between perceived susceptibility to
  HIV and HIV testing intention among college students. We hypothesized that the
  moderating role of HIV-related stigma would be differential between
  heterosexual and sexual minority college students. We administered a survey
  focused on HIV-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors in Spring 2016 (N =
  2,159). We used multi-group path analysis to analyze the hypothesized
  moderation. HIV-related stigma moderated the relation between perceived
  susceptibility and testing intention for heterosexual, but not sexual minority
  college students. Specifically, higher HIV-related stigma decreased the
  association between perceived susceptibility and testing intention. These
  results demonstrate the importance of priority population segmentation for HIV
  testing campaigns.
